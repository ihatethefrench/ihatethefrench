# contributing

welp, you heard it here first. i'm super pedantic about contributing to my code, no matter how crappy it actually is



here's some general standards i'd politely ask you to to stick to:

- try to format your code similarly to how i do
- try to format text & strings similarly to how i do
- please be prepared that i will see your pull request and most likely implement it in my own way instead



but jnats, why do you do this ?



i come from a long-standing background of shitheads and chucklefucks. being pedantic about stuff is in my blood and when things arent *just right*, i get shifty and physically uncomfortable, sorry !



although most likely nobody will end up contributing code to any of my projects anyways, since my projects always fall into two categories:

- absolute dogshit
- already perfect



but this serves as a general guideline for whomever it may concern. thanks for reading and good luck !

hi! my name is jnats.
i'm a 17 year old aspiring sysadmin and procrastinator. if you've stumbled across this page, there is no hope for either of us, so why not sit around a while and check out my repos ?

warning: there's some realllll old bad code hidden within them

in the meantime, check out some projects that actually *matter*:

- [salyut.one](https://salyut.one) 
- [crystalux](https://github.com/crystalux-project)

i am also very, very pedantic about small and insignificant things, sorry !

check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for pr guidelines
